        <p>Modern macroeconomics—particularly the tradition of
        <em>New Open Economy Macroeconomics (NOEM)</em>—has been shaped largely by the
        experience of advanced, financially integrated small open economies. Its foundational
        stylised facts are well established: prices and wages are sticky; foreign exchange is abundant
        and freely traded; capital markets are deep and smooth cyclical fluctuations; and credible
        monetary policy anchors inflation expectations. In such environments, domestic capital
        overwhelmingly dominates total investment, inflation is primarily home-grown, and monetary
        policy transmits effectively through the interest-rate channel. External balance, in turn, is
        maintained through flexible exchange-rate adjustment with incomplete but predictable pass-through.</p>

        <p>By contrast, the stylised facts that define <em>developing and low-income open economies</em>
        are fundamentally different. Prices are relatively flexible, and imported inflation transmits rapidly to
        domestic prices. Nominal exchange rates are fixed or tightly managed, so external imbalances adjust through
        movements in foreign reserves at the central bank. Fiscal dominance and shallow capital markets render the
        traditional interest-rate channel of monetary transmission largely ineffective, while financial intermediation
        remains predominantly bank-based. Domestic capital represents only a small fraction of the total capital stock,
        reflecting high import dependence for both consumption and investment goods.</p>

        <p>In these economies, macroeconomic adjustment occurs primarily through <em>quantity changes</em> in the
        volume of bank credit, foreign exchange use and allocation, and fluctuations in real output rather than in prices.
        Therefore, inflation, nominal exchange rates, and interest rates are poor signals of underlying macroeconomic
        conditions and provide limited guidance for forward-looking expectations. This configuration defines a distinctive form of openness—not rooted in financial integration,
        but in <em>import dependence and persistent foreign exchange scarcity</em>.</p>

        <p>Building on these empirical realities, my research develops a new analytical framework:
        <strong>New Structural Open Economy Macroeconomics (NSOEM)</strong>, which replaces the analytical role of price rigidity
        with the <em>availability of foreign exchange</em>. The framework embeds the external sector, fiscal operations, and the
        banking system within a unified <em>stock–flow accounting structure</em>, offering a coherent explanation for the stylised
        facts that characterise developing and import-dependent economies.</p>

        <p><em>New Structural Open Economy Macroeconomics</em> advances this agenda by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Updating the stylised facts that contemporary macro theory must explain;</li>
          <li>Developing new tools, such as an FX-constrained output gap and an import-driven aggregate supply function;</li>
          <li>Embedding financial intermediaries explicitly within the adjustment process;</li>
          <li>Identifying threshold effects in policy effectiveness—for example, limits of inflation targeting under high import shares; and </li> 
          <li>Anchoring analysis in stock–flow consistent models that capture both the flow and accumulation of foreign assets and liabilities across sectors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Precursors</h3>
<p>
  Traditional Structuralist Macroeconomics long emphasised import dependence, foreign exchange constraints, and
  supply-side bottlenecks. Yet its focus on real-sector relationships often overlooked the roles of money, banking, and
  the stock dimensions of the external constraint, favouring flow-based analyses instead. The 
  <em>Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments (MABP)</em>, by contrast, takes the opposite view—treating external
  imbalances as the result of monetary disequilibrium. However, money demand functions are notoriously unstable, and this
  line of research pays scant attention to the real sector and institutional structure of developing economies. 
  Both traditions also remain detached from contemporary debates—such as the flattening of the Phillips Curve—or from
  modern modelling innovations grounded in microfoundations.
</p>


        <p>My work also shares analytical affinities with other traditions. Post-Keynesian and Kaleckian frameworks highlight
        demand-led growth, financial fragility, and income distribution, while recent research on dominant currency pricing
        underscores that international trade is largely invoiced in foreign currency. Each recognises the importance of external
        constraint, but none systematically integrates foreign exchange, banking, and fiscal operations within a stock–flow
        consistent framework. More importantly, they do not explore how the inadequate supply of foreign exchange reshapes core
        macroeconomic relationships—business cycle dynamics, output-gap measurement, inflation targeting, or the slope of the
        Phillips Curve.</p>
