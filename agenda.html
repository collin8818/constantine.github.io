       <p> <em>New Open Economy Macroeconomics (NOEM)</em> is shaped by the experience of advanced and financially integrated small open economies. Its foundational stylised facts are well established: domestic prices adjust slowly; foreign exchange is abundant and freely traded; capital markets are deep; and independent central banks anchor inflation expectations. In these settings, domestic marginal cost is the anchor of the Phillips curve, inflation is largely home-grown, monetary policy transmits reliably through the interest rate, and the exchange rate serves as a stabiliser with moderate and predictable pass-through.</p>

  

    <p>These assumptions travel poorly to <em>small open developing economies</em>. In this case, prices tend to be flexible rather than sticky, and import prices and exchange-rate movements transmit rapidly into domestic inflation. Production relies heavily on imported capital goods, so marginal cost is externally determined. As a result, nominal depreciation raises costs and inflation instead of competitiveness, and the exchange rate acts as a <em>shock transmitter</em> rather than an absorber. FX-denominated balance sheets reinforce this dynamic and contribute to persistent trend depreciation. Two implications follow. First, monetary policy loses traction: the central bank has limited influence over inflation expectations when external prices dominate domestic marginal cost. Second, fiscal policy is constrained by foreign-exchange availability under fixed pegs and the need to stabilise the exchange rate under pure floats.</p>

        <p>Building on these empirical realities, my research develops a <strong>New Structural Open Economy Macroeconomics (NSOEM)</strong>.  The framework embeds the external sector, fiscal operations, and the
        banking system within a unified <em>stock–flow accounting structure</em>, offering a coherent explanation for the stylised
        facts that characterise developing and import-dependent economies.</p>

        <p><em>New Structural Open Economy Macroeconomics</em> advances this agenda by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Updating the stylised facts of SODEs that contemporary macro theory must explain;</li>
          <li>Developing new tools, such as an FX-constrained output gap and an import-driven aggregate supply function;</li>
          <li>Embedding financial intermediaries explicitly within the adjustment process;</li>
          <li>Identifying threshold effects in policy effectiveness—for example, limits of inflation targeting under high import shares; and </li> 
          <li>Anchoring analysis in stock–flow consistent models that capture both the flow and accumulation of foreign assets and liabilities across sectors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Precursors</h3>
<p>
  Traditional Structuralist Macroeconomics long emphasised import dependence, foreign exchange constraints, and
  supply-side bottlenecks. Yet its focus on real-sector relationships often overlooked the roles of money, banking, and
  the stock dimensions of the external constraint, favouring flow-based analyses instead. The 
  <em>Monetary Approach to the Balance of Payments (MABP)</em>, by contrast, takes the opposite view—treating external
  imbalances as the result of monetary disequilibrium. However, money demand functions are notoriously unstable, and this
  line of research pays scant attention to the real sector and institutional structure of developing economies. 
  Both traditions also remain detached from contemporary debates—such as the flattening of the Phillips Curve—or from
  modern modelling innovations grounded in microfoundations.
</p>


        <p>My work also shares analytical affinities with other traditions. Post-Keynesian and Kaleckian frameworks highlight
        demand-led growth, financial fragility, and income distribution, while recent research on dominant currency pricing
        underscores that international trade is largely invoiced in foreign currency. Each recognises the importance of external
        constraint, but none systematically integrates foreign exchange, banking, and fiscal operations within a stock–flow
        consistent framework. More importantly, they do not explore how the inadequate supply of foreign exchange reshapes core
        macroeconomic relationships—business cycle dynamics, output-gap measurement, inflation targeting, or the slope of the
        Phillips Curve.</p>
