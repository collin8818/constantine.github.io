  Collin M. Constantine is a College Assistant Professor of Economics (with tenure) and Official Fellow at Girton College, University of Cambridge, where he also serves as Director of Studies in Economics. He holds an adjunct appointment at the University of Notre Dame (London), and is Co-Editor of <em>Economics</em> (Open-Access Journal) as well as a member of the Editorial Review Board of the <em>Journal of Stratification Economics</em>.
</p>
</p>
      <p>His research lies at the intersection of international macroeconomics and finance, political economy, and economic development. He focuses on exchange rate dynamics, fiscal-monetary interactions, macroeconomic measurement, and the distribution of income and wealth. Motivated by empirical puzzles that standard models struggle to explain, he develops new theoretical frameworks and tests their implications with data.</p>
      <p>Constantine’s current projects revisit classic debates on the “Dutch Disease,” shifting attention from resource windfalls to the macro-finance consequences of central bank financing of fiscal deficits. He is also advancing new perspectives on fiscal dominance, geoeconomics, and the measurement of macroeconomic fundamentals in balance-of-payments–constrained economies.</p>
      <p>This website provides access to his latest research, typically in the form of working papers and projects in progress. A complete record of publications and academic activities is available in his Curriculum Vitae.</p>

        Overheating on Ice: Mis-measuring Inflation and Output Gaps in SOEs

          A flatter Phillips curve in open economies — where imports form a share of consumption
and production costs — renders CPI-based inflation a lagging indicator of excess demand,
increasing the risk of understating economic overheating. I develop a model that connects
excess demand with forex market pressure, captured by an external output gap — defined
as the deviation of output from the balance-of-payments consistent level. The external
output gap serves as a leading indicator of overheating, where excess demand is masked
by subdued CPI-based inflation (overheating on ice). The model introduces a composite
output gap as a weighted average of domestic and external gaps. Crucially, it can be
positive even when the domestic output gap is negative, leading to biased estimates from
filtering methods. Incorporating the composite gap into business cycle analysis is essential
to prevent excessively loose policy, while a focus on non-tradable or cost-based inflation
is required to assess domestic inflationary pressures.

        Tariffs, Fiscal Policy, and the U.S. Trade Deficit: A Macro-Finance Perspective

          This article develops a model to examine the U.S. trade deficit, motivated by three facts:
(i) a clockwise convergence dynamic between the trade balance and nominal exchange
rate (1990Q4–2009Q1); (ii) the central role of valuation effects in external adjustment; and
(iii) the macro-financial disruptions following the 2025 Trump tariffs. The framework
combines a short-run trade balance schedule — capturing goods-market equilibrium and
valuation effects — with a long-run schedule consistent with a stable NIIP and no persistent
asset revaluations. Calibration suggests that the trade deficit reflects persistent
under-investment relative to the Golden Rule benchmark. Tariff shocks trigger financial
decoupling — rising inflation expectations and long-term borrowing costs — which reduce
the expected return on U.S. assets, depress asset prices, and curb domestic absorption.
These effects generate dollar depreciation and a smaller equilibrium trade deficit. The
optimal unilateral tariff is 8.32 percent, and the optimal fiscal deficit share of GDP is 0.135
percent.

Dismal Macroeconomics: The Case of Small Open Dependent Economies

      <summary>Read more</summary>
      <div class="paper-abstract">
        <p>
          This article presents a simple macro model that qualitatively fits several dismal facts of Caribbean economies, including low growth and high public debt ratios, high unemployment, persistent fiscal dominance, repeated balance of payments crises, trend decrease in productivity growth, high rates of skilled migration, persistent excess bank reserves, and wide interest rate spreads in commercial banks. The motivation for this model extends beyond these observations. Another goal is to emphasise the importance of economic theory for prediction, empirical research, and policy analysis, and to stimulate theoretical research in the region. The model has three key components: (i) a bank-based aggregate demand, (ii) a balance of payments constraint, and (iii) a supply constraint exacerbated by skilled migration in the very long term. In equilibrium, the model derives six distinct economic regimes that can account for diverse country experiences. Overall, fiscal dominance is the key causal factor of the dismal macro facts.
