  Collin M. Constantine is a College Assistant Professor of Economics (with tenure) and Official Fellow at Girton College, University of Cambridge, where he also serves as Director of Studies in Economics. He holds an adjunct appointment at the University of Notre Dame (London), and is Co-Editor of <em>Economics</em> (Open-Access Journal) as well as a member of the Editorial Review Board of the <em>Journal of Stratification Economics</em>.
</p>
</p>
      <p>His research lies at the intersection of international macroeconomics and finance, and the political economy of development, with a central focus on how macro-financial dynamics and distributional cleavages shape economic outcomes in small open and multi-ethnic societies. By reframing debates on exchange rate dynamics, fiscal-monetary interactions, and inequality, his work challenges conventional models and advances new theoretical frameworks that resolve persistent empirical puzzles.</p>
      <p>One strand of this agenda revisits classic debates on the “Dutch Disease” and "Resource Curse," shifting attention from resource windfalls to the macro-financial consequences of central bank financing of fiscal deficits. This work advances new perspectives on fiscal dominance, geoeconomics, and the measurement of macroeconomic fundamentals in balance-of-payments–constrained economies.</p>
      <p>Another strand examines how ethnic and class divisions jointly shape development outcomes in multi-ethnic societies. Motivated by the legacy of ethnic conflict in his home country (Guyana), Constantine has analysed the distributional regimes of emerging economies such as China, South Africa, Chile, Guyana, and Mexico, with a focus on the drivers of inequality and their implications for economic theory. The distinctive contribution of this work is its joint analysis of class and ethnicity, addressing key questions about when class overrides ethnicity as the primary axis of conflict, how ethnic ideology shapes inequality, and the political economy constraints that limit redistribution in diverse societies.</p>
