  Collin M. Constantine is a College Assistant Professor of Economics (with tenure) and Official Fellow at Girton College, University of Cambridge, where he also serves as Director of Studies in Economics. He holds an adjunct appointment at the University of Notre Dame (London), and is Co-Editor of <em>Economics</em> (Open-Access Journal) as well as a member of the Editorial Review Board of the <em>Journal of Stratification Economics</em>.

      <p>His research develops tractable models to address empirical puzzles in exchange rate dynamics, fiscal–monetary interactions, and inequality, with a central focus on how macro-financial dynamics and distributional cleavages shape economic outcomes in small open and multi-ethnic economies.</p>
      <p>One strand of this agenda revisits classic debates on the “Dutch Disease” and "Resource Curse," shifting attention from resource windfalls to the macro-financial consequences of central bank financing of fiscal deficits. This work advances new perspectives on fiscal dominance, geoeconomics, and the measurement of macroeconomic fundamentals in balance-of-payments–constrained economies. Another strand develops formal frameworks for the joint analysis of class and ethnicity, generating testable hypotheses on inequality, ideology, and the political economy constraints that limit redistribution in diverse societies.</p>
     <p>Together, these projects establish a research agenda at the intersection of international macroeconomics, finance, and political economy. His work exemplifies applied theory as a bridge between rigorous modelling and the pressing policy challenges of small open and multi-ethnic economies, providing a unified framework for understanding how institutional, economic, and political factors shape inequality, stabilisation, and growth.</p>
