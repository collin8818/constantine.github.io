  Collin M. Constantine is a College Assistant Professor of Economics (with tenure) and Official Fellow at Girton College, University of Cambridge, where he also serves as Director of Studies in Economics. He holds an adjunct appointment at the University of Notre Dame (London), and is Co-Editor of <em>Economics</em> (Open-Access Journal) as well as a member of the Editorial Review Board of the <em>Journal of Stratification Economics</em>.
</p>
</p>
      <p>His research develops new theoretical models to address empirical puzzles in international macroeconomics and finance, and the political economy of development, with a central focus on how macro-financial dynamics and distributional cleavages shape economic outcomes in small open and multi-ethnic societies. By reframing debates on exchange rate dynamics, fiscal-monetary interactions, and inequality, his work builds tractable frameworks that yield testable implications and offer new perspectives on policy constraints in open and diverse economies.</p>
      <p>One strand of this agenda revisits classic debates on the “Dutch Disease” and "Resource Curse," shifting attention from resource windfalls to the macro-financial consequences of central bank financing of fiscal deficits. This work advances new perspectives on fiscal dominance, geoeconomics, and the measurement of macroeconomic fundamentals in balance-of-payments–constrained economies.</p>
      <p>Another strand develops a joint analysis of class and ethnicity to explain how distributional cleavages shape inequality and development. Drawing on the experience of multi-ethnic societies such as Guyana, South Africa, and Mexico, Constantine formalises mechanisms traditionally examined through narrative approaches, creating testable hypotheses on when class overrides ethnicity, how ideology shapes inequality, and what political economy constraints limit redistribution.</p>
     <p>Together, these strands form a unified program aimed at integrating macro-finance with the political economy of inequality, offering new theoretical tools for understanding the development trajectories of emerging economies.</p>
