  Collin M. Constantine is a College Assistant Professor of Economics (with tenure) and Official Fellow at Girton College, University of Cambridge, where he also serves as Director of Studies in Economics. He holds an adjunct appointment at the University of Notre Dame (London), and is Co-Editor of <em>Economics</em> (Open-Access Journal) as well as a member of the Editorial Review Board of the <em>Journal of Stratification Economics</em>.

      <p>Constantine is developing a research agenda that combines rigorous theoretical modelling with pressing policy questions. He builds tractable models to address empirical puzzles in exchange rate dynamics, fiscal-monetary interactions, and inequality, with a focus on how macro-financial dynamics and distributional cleavages shape outcomes in small open and multi-ethnic economies.</p>
      <p>One strand redefines classic debates on the “Dutch Disease” and the “Resource Curse,” showing how central bank financing of fiscal deficits drives inflation, real exchange rate appreciation, and financial distortions in resource-based economies. This reinterpretation underscores the role of distributional conflict, where political pressures to expand wages and spending exceed available rents and force central banks into deficit financing. It also offers new perspectives on fiscal dominance and the paradox of banking, where resource wealth is often accompanied by excess bank reserves, widening interest rate spreads, and related distortions.</p>
      <p>Beyond the paradoxes of plenty and banking, his research advances understanding of fiscal-debt sustainability, the measurement of macroeconomic fundamentals in balance-of-payments–constrained economies, inflation in open economies, and the political economy of trade conflict.   Another strand examines how class and ethnic divisions jointly structure inequality and development outcomes. Motivated by the legacy of ethnic conflict in his home country, Constantine develops formal models that generate testable implications for how ideology, inequality, and distributional conflict constrain policy space. This research shows how redistributive struggles shape macroeconomic choices, linking class-ethnicity cleavages to fiscal dominance, limited stabilisation capacity, and sharp policy trade-offs in multi-ethnic societies.<p>
     <p>These projects establish a research agenda at the intersection of international macroeconomics, finance, and political economy. By connecting distributive conflict to fiscal dominance and class-ethnicity cleavages to policy trade-offs, his work exemplifies applied theory as a bridge between rigorous modelling and the pressing challenges of small open and multi-ethnic economies.</p>
