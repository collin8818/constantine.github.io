      <p>
    Modern open-economy macroeconomics—particularly the tradition of 
    <em>New Open Economy Macroeconomics (NOEM)</em>—has been shaped largely by the 
    experience of advanced, financially integrated small open economies. 
    Its foundational stylised facts are well established: prices and wages are sticky; 
    foreign exchange is abundant and freely traded; capital markets are deep and 
    smooth cyclical fluctuations; and credible monetary policy anchors inflation expectations. 
    In such environments, domestic capital overwhelmingly dominates total investment, 
    inflation is primarily home-grown, and monetary policy transmits effectively through the 
    interest-rate channel. External balance, in turn, is maintained through flexible 
    exchange-rate adjustment with incomplete but predictable pass-through.
  </p>

  <p>
    By contrast, the stylised facts that define 
    <em>developing and low-income open economies</em> are fundamentally different. 
    Prices are relatively flexible, and imported inflation transmits rapidly to 
    domestic prices. Nominal exchange rates are fixed or tightly managed, so 
    external imbalances adjust through movements in foreign reserves at the central bank. 
    Fiscal dominance and shallow capital markets render the traditional interest-rate channel 
    of monetary transmission largely ineffective, while financial intermediation remains 
    predominantly bank-based. Domestic capital represents only a small fraction of the total 
    capital stock, reflecting high import dependence for both consumption and investment goods.
  </p>

  <p>
    In these economies, macroeconomic adjustment occurs primarily through 
    <em>quantity changes</em>—in the volume of bank credit, foreign exchange use and allocation, 
    and fluctuations in real output rather than in prices. Inflation, nominal exchange rates, 
    and interest rates are poor signals of underlying macroeconomic conditions and provide limited 
    guidance for forward-looking expectations. This configuration of fiscal–monetary–external 
    interdependence defines a distinctive form of openness—not rooted in financial integration, 
    but in <em>import dependence and persistent foreign exchange scarcity</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Building on these empirical realities, my research develops a new analytical framework: 
    <strong>Structural Open Economy Macroeconomics (SOEM)</strong>, which replaces the 
    analytical role of price rigidity with the <em>availability of foreign exchange</em>. 
    The framework embeds the external sector, fiscal operations, and the banking system within 
    a unified <em>stock–flow accounting structure</em>, offering a coherent explanation for the 
    stylised facts that characterise developing and import-dependent economies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Traditional Structuralist Macroeconomics long emphasised import dependence, foreign exchange 
    constraints, and supply-side bottlenecks. Yet its focus on real-sector relationships often 
    overlooked the roles of money, banking, and the stock dimensions of the external constraint, 
    favouring flow-based analyses instead. Moreover, it remained detached from contemporary debates—such 
    as the flattening of the Phillips Curve—or from modern modelling innovations grounded in microfoundations.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work also shares analytical affinities with other traditions. Post-Keynesian and Kaleckian frameworks 
    highlight demand-led growth, financial fragility, and income distribution, while recent research on 
    dominant currency pricing underscores that international trade is largely invoiced in foreign currency. 
    Each recognises the importance of external constraint, but none systematically integrates foreign exchange, 
    banking, and fiscal operations within a stock–flow consistent framework. More importantly, they do not explore 
    how the inadequate supply of foreign exchange reshapes core macroeconomic relationships—business cycle dynamics, 
    output-gap measurement, inflation targeting, or the slope of the Phillips Curve.
  </p>


  <p><em>New Structural Open Economy Macroeconomics</em> advances this agenda by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Updating the stylised facts that contemporary macroeconomic theory must explain for developing and import-dependent economies;</li>
    <li>Developing new theoretical tools, such as a foreign-exchange-constrained output gap and an import-driven aggregate supply function;</li>
    <li>Embedding financial intermediaries explicitly within the macroeconomic adjustment process;</li>
    <li>Identifying threshold effects in policy effectiveness—for example, the limits of inflation targeting under high import shares; and</li>
    <li>Anchoring analysis in stock–flow consistent models that capture both the flow and accumulation of foreign assets and liabilities across sectors.</li>
  </ul>
